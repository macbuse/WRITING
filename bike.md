# Life on a bike

For almost as long as I can remember I have ridden a bike.
As a four year old I would go out and ride round the neighborhood.
For the tiny being that I was it was a great adventure to be two or three
hundred metres from my parents house. Digging up the garden looking for hidden treasure or dinosaur bones was great but the thrill of roaming unfettered in the bigger world was really something. There I was innocently pedaling around a loop smiling at the folks I met. Round and round I went in the hamster wheel thinking how great it all was whilst dreaming of one day rocketing off to the Moon or Mars or the Milky Way.

Time passed and I grew into a teenager. My brother got a red racing bike for
Xmas and we shared it. Superficially it was a copy of a bike that had won the Tour de France. Looking back now it was a clunky steel monstrosity but I rode many miles around town and even ventured into the countryside. Once I even made it as far as my grandmother's place  more than ten miles away. The part's were of poor quality, difficult to adjust. The wheels in particular were very poor. Spokes got bent and broke and the rims were cheap pressed steel. Truing them was a daily chore. Stopping in the rain was almost impossible as the brake pads slid over the shiny chromed steel rims.

I went to university and bought a red bike of my own. Despite having a french name it was just as clunky as my brother's machine. My expeditions into the country were longer and I discovered strange roads that would peter out into dirt tracks in the forest plantations.  

The black carbon bikes were my mistresses. The first I built up myself in time
honored fashion but the second I bought ready to ride from the box. She was so
sleek, the delicateness of the touch of her electronic gears, the whirring of the motor as the front derailleur centered itself
so that the chain didn't grind against it. It was all too perfect. It is said
that men like things and women people. There is no more perfect thing than
a perfectly equipped carbon fibre bike. Of course I had to change the wheels.
It's not that they were the steel rimmed horrors of my youth but it was like
having a super model wearing  a pair of shabby training shoes on the catwalk.
Carbon rims and spokes shod with sleek tubular tyres, they felt almost weightless seemingly defying the laws of physics. And the noise - a mix of the purr of the freehub and the subdued roar of the rubber on tarmac - added to the sensation of finally owning my dream.

Over the years the handlebars went down and the seat up. I spent hours doing core work so that I could get down into the crouch position, forearms parallel to the ground and save the watts. Months of crunches, leg raises all sorts of fiendish exercises prostrate in front of the TV. It felt better, we fitted better together the bike and I. The saddle cradled my buttocks and my hands rested lightly on the brake hoods. Only the pedals felt marginally uncomfortable still, when I pushed hard against them, the surge of acceleration felt as good as in past years. So we were bonded together like a jockey and his mount, a primitive form of cyborg. Tiny finger movements change gear, shifting weight between hands changes direction, breaking is almost superfluous such is the understanding between man and machine. 

As a child the bike made it possible for me to explore a limited domain outside of the
confines of my parent's orbit. Then, for a time, it was way of testing myself
against others in a sort of simulacrum of combat. Now it allowed me to explore the limits of my inner self. It measured my effort continuously. So the lush greenery and the savage cliffs would melt away as I digested the fluctuating numbers ears plugged  in to a stream of beats. Though far removed from the sensory deprivation apparatus of science fiction the effect was almost the same. I plunged into an inner world, meditating on the shape of every breath, on the execution of each pedal stroke.
