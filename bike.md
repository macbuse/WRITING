# Life on a bike

For almost as long as I can remember I have ridden a bike.
As a four year old I would go out and ride round the neighborhood.
For the tiny being that I was it was a great adventure to be two or three
hundred metres from my parents house. Digging up the garden looking for hidden treasure or dinosaur bones was great but the thrill of being free in the bigger world was really something.
