# Obedience

Post confinement dreams assumed a larger place in my existence.
They lurked in those last hours of shallow sleep sharing their fragmented
stories with me.
Not quite more lucid, not quite more real but perhaps more compelling than
the drudge of daytime reality. For a while
I tried capturing the ephemeral messages they communicated. Hastily scribbling down the scenario before the last traces away were washed away with the dregs of the morning coffee.
This served as a sort of replacement for the lack of meaningful activity during the lockdown.
The spectre of creativity in the darkness of officially imposed isolation.

The birdsong and sunlight signal the close of the shadow world for this
session. Wearily I quit my companions of the night and venture forth into the realm of the day. 

The morning routine began with an analysis of the media's latest outpourings: 
- casualty numbers
- estimates of the on running costs
- a tour of the hospitals
- an interview with someone of importance.

The ritual plays out each morning. Solemnly they utter the words, nodding
meaningfully, pausing measuredly. The illusion only broken by the advertising
breaks vaunting the benefits of products that are for the moment locked away in
shops forbidden to open.

So while some soberly act out the role of the high priest many other journalists, like the much despised money-changers of the temple, scratch a living from a constant exchange of vapid ideas. Their contribution to society so negligible as to be quite homeopathic. A medicine that cures ailments by leveraging the placebo effect. After an hour or so of listening to the parade of experts on TV and scanning the new sites I was none the wiser, indeed all that this circus had achieved was to reinforce my pessimism for the fate of humankind. 
For,  such was the state of ignorance as to the nature of the virus,
all they could do was to enjoin us to continue hiding ourselves away.

And so we did. Obediently waiting for the day when the all clear would sound
and we could once again go down into the city streets and mingle with the throng. Once there we should do our duty as citizens and consumers, spending profligately that the mighty wheels of capitalism, 
frozen for the moment, might turn once more.

Indeed, the virus had accomplished that which our leaders had so often told us
was simply impossible. The inevitable progress of capitalism and his bastard
child globalisation had been halted abruptly. For forty years and more the massed armies of
communism  had toiled relentlessly without ever come close to achieving such a feat, yet a microscopic
scrap of life in a matter of weeks had paralysed the fearless economies of the
free world.

Nothing could be the same again. So they chanted. We must forget their errors
of the past. Not merely forgive them but forget, wipe them clean. Then together we would be going to a better
place, a new world where the most vulnerable would still be with us. Well at least
for the handful of months that fate might have allotted them given their
advanced years. Those most vulnerable, a peculiar almost Dickensian phrase,
conjuring visions of wretched orphans falling into the hands of vile
slave masters. Those poor unfortunates, the prospect of a life of misery before
them. But the most vulnerable who now were the wheezing old, their lives well
spent, often packed with memories of the post-war Golden Age.

So we obeyed and traded the lives of our children for a few months more.

I had a father who died just before everything changed. It wasn't an abrupt
parting but a goodbye drawn out over a year or so. There was an initial event,
something we had been waiting for, dreading since he stopped work and joined
the leisured classes. For most it might seem a trivial thing but when he
decided that golf was no longer his passion then both my brother and I feared
that the time was, if not upon us, not so very far off.
To know and accept is a rare quality in a world of fierce individualism. To
fight for the last crumb, the last gasp of air, as inelegant and barbaric as
that might be, is the custom now days. So he went, knowing his time had come,
that many he loved had gone before and that to cling on, a burden to others as
his inevitable decline played out, would be an act of brazen selfishness. 

There is a world out there in the daylight ready to convince you that to see
mortality in this way is wrong, romantic foolery at best, most likely dangerous heresy. For we must compete, strive to appease the socio-economic orthodoxy. To simply let go of the material is an verging on a declaration of war, insurrection. And those eloquent commentators defended a right to life above all other considerations. There seems a deep flaw in their arguments, when you weigh the unspent years of the young that must be sacrificed so that their vulnerable elders might wheeze away a few more bedridden months.

Amidst the bland banter an occasional voice stands out wondering why, after of
centuries where lives were cheap, that now even those last few wrinkly,
incontinent  years
are deemed to be worth more than the combined wealth of nations. A century ago
the youth of Europe were mown down on muddy battlefields in the defense of
their fellow countrymen and common ideals. Fields of crosses stand honoring their
sacrifice. What will be erected as a monument to the spoiled lives this time?

Stern faces in white coats tell us that there was no other humane option. Their
oaths demand that they protect life and we must all, no matter what our
profession or vocation, renounce our common rights that they might respect
their sacred vows. So we did but for what? The angel of death passed by and swept off with many
souls, but were they not those whose time was already almost at hand?

The young are masked, cleansing their hands as they enter, forbidden to form in groups in public. Festivities are policed if not cancelled. No more birthdays, no more raves, no more weddings. The music has been silenced by medical decree. Unsold bouquets of flowers fade in the summer sun. Unfulfilled dreams abound in a world holding its breath lest some frail old soul be touched by the invisible enemy lurking in its lungs. Unloved and hidden behind masks girls and boys are anonymous pawns in a stale game played out between doctors, industrialists and politicians.

Breath is precious. Breathing is potentially lethal. Each unfiltered lungful of air in public is to
be accounted for. The future of humanity is in the balance and unprotected
exhalation borders on being an assassination attempt. Authorities must act
swiftly to mercilessly stamp out such anti social behaviour.
