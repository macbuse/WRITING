# Obedience

Post confinement dreams assumed a larger place in my existence. They
lurked in those last hours of shallow sleep sharing their fragmented
stories with me. Not quite more lucid, not quite more real but perhaps
more compelling than the drudge of daytime reality. For a while I tried
capturing the ephemeral messages they communicated. Hastily scribbling
down the scenario before the last traces are washed away with the dregs of
the morning coffee. This served as a sort of replacement for the lack of
meaningful activity during the lock down. The spectre of creativity in the
darkness of officially imposed isolation.

The birdsong and sunlight signal the closure of my shadow world for this
session. Wearily I quit my companions of the night and venture forth into
the realm of the day. 

The morning routine begins with an analysis of the media's latest outpourings: 
- casualty numbers
- estimates of the on running costs
- a tour of the hospitals
- an interview with someone of importance.

The ritual plays out each morning. Solemnly they utter their words,
nodding meaningfully, pausing measuredly. The illusion only broken by the
advertising breaks vaunting the benefits of products that are for the
moment locked away in shops forbidden to open.

So while some soberly act out the role of the high priest many other
journalists, like the much despised money-changers of the temple, scratch
a living from a constant exchange of vapid ideas. Their contribution to
society so negligible as to be quite homeopathic. A medicine that cures
ailments by leveraging the placebo effect. After an hour or so of
listening to the parade of experts on TV and scanning the new sites I was
none the wiser, indeed all that this circus had achieved was to reinforce
my pessimism for the fate of humankind. For,  such was the state of
ignorance as to the nature of the virus, all they could do was to enjoin
us to continue hiding ourselves away.

And so we did. Obediently waiting for the day when the all clear would sound
and we could once again go down into the city streets and mingle with the
throng. Once there we should do our duty as citizens and consumers, spending
profligately that the mighty wheels of capitalism, frozen for the moment, might
turn once more.

Indeed, the virus had accomplished that which our leaders had so often told us
was simply impossible. The inevitable progress of capitalism and its bastard
child globalisation were halted abruptly. For forty years and more the massed
armies of communism  had toiled relentlessly without ever having come close to
achieving such a feat, yet a microscopic scrap of life in a matter of weeks had
paralysed the fearless economies of the free world.

Nothing could be the same again. So they chanted. We must forget their
errors of the past. Not merely forgive them but forget, wipe them clean.
Then together we would be going to a better place, a new world where the
most vulnerable would still be with us. Well at least for the handful of
months that fate might have allotted them given their advanced years.
Those most vulnerable, a peculiar almost Dickensian phrase, conjuring
visions of wretched orphans falling into the hands of vile gang masters.
Those poor unfortunates, the prospect of a life of misery before them. But
the most vulnerable who now were the wheezing old, their lives well spent,
often packed with memories of the post-war Golden Age.

So we obeyed and traded the lives of our children for a few months more.

I had a father who died just before everything changed. It wasn't an abrupt
parting but a goodbye drawn out over a year or so. There was an initial event,
something we had been waiting for, dreading since he stopped work and joined
the leisured classes. For most it might seem a trivial thing but when he
decided that golf was no longer his passion then both my brother and
I feared that the time was, if not upon us, not so very far off. To know
and accept is a rare quality in a world of fierce individualism. To fight
for the last crumb, the last gasp of air, as inelegant and barbaric as
that might be, is the custom now days. So he went, knowing his time had
come, that many he loved had gone before and that to cling on, a burden to
others as his inevitable decline played out, would be an act of brazen
selfishness. 

There is a world out there in the daylight ready to convince you that to
see mortality in this way is wrong, romantic foolery at best, most likely
dangerous heresy. For we must compete, strive to appease the
socio-economic orthodoxy. To simply let go of the material is an verging
on a declaration of war, insurrection. And those eloquent commentators
defended a right to life above all other considerations. There seems
a deep flaw in their arguments, when you weigh the unspent years of the
young that must be sacrificed so that their vulnerable elders might wheeze
away a few more bedridden months.

Amidst the bland banter an occasional voice stands out wondering why,
after of centuries where lives were cheap, that now even those last few
wrinkly, incontinent  years are deemed to be worth more than the combined
wealth of nations. A century ago the youth of Europe were mown down on
muddy battlefields in the defense of their fellow countrymen and common
ideals. Fields of crosses stand honoring their sacrifice. What will be
erected as a monument to the spoiled lives this time?

Stern faces in white coats tell us that there was no other humane option.
Their oaths demand that they protect life and we must all, no matter what
our profession or vocation, renounce our common rights that they might
respect their sacred vows. So we did but for what? The angel of death
passed by and swept up many souls, but were they not those whose time was
already almost at hand?

The young are masked, cleansing their hands as they enter, forbidden to
form in groups in public. Festivities are policed if not cancelled. No
more birthdays, no more raves, no more weddings. The music has been
silenced by medical decree. Unsold bouquets of flowers fade in the summer
sun. Unfulfilled dreams abound in a world holding its breath lest some
frail old soul be touched by the invisible enemy lurking in their lungs.
Unloved and hidden behind masks girls and boys are anonymous pawns in
a stale game played out between doctors, industrialists and politicians.

Breath is precious. Breathing is potentially lethal. Each unfiltered lungful of
air in public is to be accounted for. The future of humanity is in the balance
and unprotected exhalation borders on being an assassination attempt.
Authorities must act swiftly to mercilessly stamp out such anti social
behaviour.

# Passage of time

A year has passed since I wrote. The world is still under sway of the
hypoccratocracy, that class who swear by the hippocratic oath. They have less
airtime now but still invite themselves to preach their sermon their themes well
worn, well trodden like the stone stairs in a monastery:
- masks and restrictions 
- vaccinations.

Things shutdown, reopened timidly and now, so we learn, a new storm is gathering itself on the horizon promising an autumn of being battened down again. But there will be a brief truce in their war, the time to have a neutered holiday season. For indeed should the masses not enjoy their two weeks of summer hedonism they might revolt and worse the hotels and restaurants that cater to these hordes of tourist might succumb to the same fate as the factories in the north. It's a fact that one rarely hears of the imminent extinction of those hideous creatures that lurk in night or infest sewers for they can't elicit the empathy that some furry little ball with cute eyes does. So the grim factories belching foul smoke have passed into history but the couple with their quaint little restaurant or their campsite by the sea must survive whatever the cost. 


Waves have come and gone leaving the politicians ever more nervous. Like Canute they proclaim their sovereignty over the rising tide but within a short time, in the face of the exponential, they will inevitably announce a forced retreat to cowering at home. Slowly a few of the talking heads on the media begin to envisage a long term, perhaps permanent change in social behaviour. Forever filtering one's breath, forever cleansing one's paws, digital brands for the properly vaccinated allowing the chosen to participate in socialising as before. The glittering prize of liberation that the vaccinateurs conjured for   us has evaporated like all mirages must. Though virtually compulsory, the vaccines have not proved the invincible shield marketed 12 months ago. Reluctance of some to submit themselves to the trial in the wild of a radically new treatment means that collective, for we no longer say herd with its sheepish connotations, immunity seems a distant, unattainable goal.

So where are we now? And, more importantly, where are we going?

Well where have we been?

There was that initial period of hubris and denial when we were told that the ramparts of the health system were strong enough to repulse the asian threat. Next there was a brutal return to medieval times when only  isolation could save us from the ravages of the plague. Then there was a summer of relief and false normality that faded into a grey winter of solitary confinement. Finally, like Persephone we were released in the spring to populate the terrasses. Somewhere in the dark of winter the vaccinations began, a stuttering mismanaged campaign that degenerated at times into  a battle of numbers between nations. With all the suffering, both physical and economic, and chaos wrecked in the world by the pandemic, one watched as politicians coldly proved how much more righteous their strategy was compared with the neighbors.

So now we are at a crossroads. For economic reasons we must surely reopen as widely as possible lest many businesses fold from the burden imposed on them during our winter of isolation. For reasons of public health according to experts this course is inherently dangerous and it would be prudent to keep some if not all restrictions in place. Perhaps they are right. The virus mutates, transforms itself unceasingly and vaccines are not sure to provide the advertised protection in such cases. So after spending billions on the magic bullet, the one shot or rather two shot cure to the plague, we are told that it is probably three shots or more. And, just to be safe, well why not stay masked forever and ever. Amen.

Between us and the experts there are a host of commentators. Exactly what a commentator really represents is difficult to know. Indeed it is a question of knowledge. A wise old Russian once confided in me that
```
- a physicist knows nothing about everything
- a mathematician knows everything about nothing
```
Thus he set the extremes of expertise and everyone else must surely fit themselves in somewhere on this spectrum. But the commentator would seem to have an authoritative opinion on everything. One resolves this apparent contradiction by observing that their opinion is not knowledge per se but some doctrinal position crafted,  according to their humour, to  dispel or reinforce the fears of the truly ignorant. Commentators are more sophisticated than their audience but are in no sense experts though they wield the jargon of the veritable expert as if it were their own. Their propositions are alternatively seductive or provocative luring us into their web of ideas. So in the aftermath they twist and turn, defending contradictory solutions but unswervingly sure of themselves. They add everything and nothing to the debate.

The unholy trinity 
- politicians 
- experts, hospital doctors, general practitioners
- commentators and lackey journalists

Weekly unto us they preach a gospel confected from suitably diverse sources. The congregation rises faithfully repeating the credo and another week passes without a concrete date for salvation.
