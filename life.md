# Life

Post confinement dreams assumed a larger place in my existence.
They lurked in those last hours of shallow sleep sharing their fragmented
stories with me.
Not quite more lucid, not quite more real but perhaps more compelling than
the drudge of daytime reality. For a while
I tried capturing the ephemeral messages they communicated. Hastily scribbling down the scenario before the last traces away were washed away with the dregs of the morning coffee.
This served as a sort of replacement for the lack of meaningful activity during the lockdown.
The spectre of creativity in the darkness of officially imposed isolation.

The birdsong and sunlight signal the close of the shadow world for this
session. Wearily I quit my companions of the night and venture forth into the realm of the day. 

The morning routine began with an analysis of the media's latest outpourings: 
- casualty numbers
- estimates of the on running costs
- a tour of the hospitals
- an interview with someone of importance.

So the journalists, like the much despised money-changers of the temple, scratched a living from a constant exchange of vapid ideas. Their contribution to society so negligible as to be quite homeopathic. A medicine that cures ailments by leveraging the placebo effect. After an hour or so of listening to the parade of experts on TV and scanning the new sites I was none the wiser, indeed all that this circus had achieved was to reinforce my pessimism for the fate of humankind. 
For,  such was the state of ignorance as to the nature of the virus,
that all they could do was to enjoin us to continue hiding ourselves away.

And so we did. Obediently waiting for the day when the all clear would sound
and we could once again go down into the city streets and mingle with the throng. Once there we should do our duty as citizens and consumers, spending profligately that the mighty wheels of capitalism, 
frozen for the moment, might turn once more.

Indeed, the virus had accomplished that which our leaders had so often told us
was simply impossible. The inevitable progress of capitalism and his bastard
child globalisation had been halted abruptly. For forty years and more the massed armies of
communism  had toiled relentlessly without ever come close to achieving such a feat, yet a microscopic
scrap of life in a matter of weeks had paralysed the fearless economies of the
free world.

Nothing could be the same again. So they chanted. We should forget their errors
of the past, not forgive them but forget. Together we were going to a better
place, a new world where the most vulnerable would be with us. Well at least
for the handful of months that fate might have allotted them.
