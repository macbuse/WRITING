The purpose to a degree is indeed to learn. 
The outcome  of the years of study 
is a scrap of paper attesting to the degree
that one has succeeded in this aim.

When one solely equates education with salary, 
it ceases to be education and reverts to be mere training.

One consequence of this is that the desire to learn in most children 
is quelled.
They find academic learning challenging because they quickly become demoralised, 
either because they are not progressing at the same rate as their peers,
or because they fail to cope with the cycle of peaks and troughs in their
performance.


Perhaps by returning to the fundamental aims of education, 
that is the development of  a life long passion for learning 
and initiation of truly democratic citizens, 
then the issues over fees, careers etc would sort themselves
without undue intervention.


This situation was created, it is not a naturally outcome of the education
system.

I think the sad thing is that degrees are solely seen as a step on a career path. Education is more than just turning out economic units, something that 150 years of government policy has failed to appreciate.
