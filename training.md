The purpose to a degree is indeed to learn. 
The outcome  of the years of study 
is a scrap of paper attesting to the degree
that one has succeeded in this aim.

When one solely equates education with salary, 
it ceases to be education and reverts to be mere training. You create an enormous divide in society from the first day of formal schooling. 

You also squash the desire to learn in most children because they find academic learning challenging, or they are not progressing at the same rate, or because they have periods of great performance, followed by troughs which they find it hard to recover from.

If education was two-fold, developing a life long love for learning and creating truly democratic citizens, then the issues over bills, careers etc would sort themselves out by and large. 


Remember, this situation was created, it is not a naturally outcome of education.

I think the sad thing is that degrees are solely seen as a step on a career path. Education is more than just turning out economic units, something that 150 years of government policy has failed to appreciate.
