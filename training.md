The purpose to a degree is indeed to learn. 
The outcome  of the years of study 
is a scrap of paper superficially attesting to the degree
that one has succeeded in this aim.
As such the award of a degree is the culmination of one's formal education.
However, when one solely equates education with future earning potential, 
it ceases to be education and reverts to be mere training.

One consequence of this is that the desire to learn challenging things in most children 
is quenched.
They find academic learning problematic because they quickly become demoralised, either because they are not progressing at the same rate as their peers,
or because they fail to cope with the quite normal cycle of peaks and troughs in
performance. 
The content themselves with the attainable goals that modern coursework is crafted to
furnish them. Gone are the days when they strived to succeed and with it the
awe of the achievements of the clever and the wise.
All knowledge is good, equal in value whether it be math, physics, literature
or advanced hair dressing and nail care.
So the youth has succumbed to the fickle charms of cultural relativism.


Perhaps by returning to the noble objectives of education, 
that is development of  a life long passion for learning 
and initiation of a truly democratic citizen, 
then the issues over fees, careers etc would sort themselves
without undue intervention.
But drunk as they are on a potent cocktail of relativism and unfettered narcissism persuading the youth to follow this path is very much a herculean task.
Indeed no politician would engage in such a folly
for it would be to renounce certain dogmas of our time:
chief among these that the consumer is always right and that the provider must necessarily incline before them.


This situation was created, it is not a naturally outcome of the education system. One can argue that it is principally the result of two things
- the installation of a system of education for the masses and, at least
    superficially, abandoning the former *elitist* model.
- the transformation of the system to conform with market principles.

Both of these were fundamental tenets of those
who sought to modernise western society throughout the 80s and the 90s.
These individuals adhered to a framework of ideas 
rooted in the work of Hayek who believed in 
a society organised around a market order in which the apparatus of state is employed almost  exclusively to enforce the legal order necessary for a market of free individuals to function.
They marketed the notion that quite anyone,
without respect of natural talent,
could succeed in this brave new world through personal improvement 
by the route of education.
So the masses queued to enroll in whatever degree took their fancy
in the belief that whatever kind of knowledge they acquired
was just as valid, as marketable
as law or microchip design or advanced civil engineering.
It is tragic that degrees are solely seen as a step on a career path. Education is more than just turning out economic units, something that 150 years of government policy has failed to appreciate.
Pity these poor souls who bought into degrees thinking
that a blind investment was going to be a winner.
