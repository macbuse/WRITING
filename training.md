The purpose to a degree is indeed to learn. 
The outcome  of the years of study 
is a scrap of paper superficially attesting to the degree
that one has succeeded in this aim.
As such the award of a degree is the culmination of one's formal education.
However, when one solely equates education with future earning potential, 
it ceases to be education and reverts to be mere training.

One consequence of this is that the desire to learn challenging things in most children 
is quenched.
They find academic learning problematic because they quickly become demoralised, either because they are not progressing at the same rate as their peers,
or because they fail to cope with the quite normal cycle of peaks and troughs in
performance. 
The content themselves with the attainable goals that modern coursework is crafted to
furnish them. Gone are the days when they strived to succeed and with it the
awe of the achievements of the clever and the wise.
All knowledge is good, equal in value whether it be math, physics, literature
or advanced hair dressing and nail care.


Perhaps by returning to the noble aims of education, 
that is the development of  a life long passion for learning 
and initiation of a truly democratic citizen, 
then the issues over fees, careers etc would sort themselves
without undue intervention.


This situation was created, it is not a naturally outcome of the education
system.

I think the sad thing is that degrees are solely seen as a step on a career path. Education is more than just turning out economic units, something that 150 years of government policy has failed to appreciate.
