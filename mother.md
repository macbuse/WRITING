She looked at the dog again. Big, muscly but cuddly in his furriness. He smiled
back at her, tongue poking out, puffing a little. Her daughter had gone off and
left her with this wonderful beast. The kid was off on the other side of the
world doing whatever and she was left feeding her pooch.

Mother went back to her office, did some accounting and called some clients.
Dog lay there on the sofa/bench puffing, eyes begging to be taken for a walk.
The hours passed. Night fell. She got up from the desk and gave in. Her day's
work was done for her but the nagging worries still hung around her.

# the dreamer

When the morning came with the birdsong and the binmen he would wake his
stomach empty if he hadn't dreamt. Sometimes he would lie there in the warm
softness of the quilt and imagine something nice for the day. An erotic
fantasy, a heroic sporting effort, a stroke of mathematical genius. The magic
had been drained from the waking world bottled and stored in some forbidden
zone. What was left was a monotonous drudge of shallow transactions between
economic agents. Their every observable action was logged and and analysed.
But in the cosy warmth of his bed nobody but he could record his dreaming.

Coffee was a ritual, bitter cheap stuff that warmed him in the chill of the
grey dawn as he scribbled his recollections in the notepad. The words came
easily pouring from the pen a little untidily, slightly too large to fit
between the lines on the page. He was embarrassed at his scrawling thoughts.
Shouldn't they be more neatly laid out like a system of equations, or a
spreadsheet with its orderly lines and columns. Orderly, ordered, obeing orders without question. That was the normative future.

# the girl

She had gone, fled the tsunami. Officially it was an epidemic but she had lived it more like the aftermath of an earthquake. A single acute event had provoked an collapse of society as it had been. All the comfortable certainties were a thing of the past - la vie d'avant. Now there was just uncertainty waiting for the next official announcement saying what was allowed and what was proscribed. The days of laws carved in stone were gone. People huddled together in front of their screens, in awe before the undulating graphs and the prescriptions that would without doubt extinguish the sickness that had so far resisted all else.
