# mother

She looked at the dog again. Big, muscly but cuddly in his furriness. He smiled
back at her, tongue poking out, puffing a little. Her daughter had gone off and
left her with this wonderful beast. The kid was off on the other side of the
world doing whatever and she was left feeding her pooch.

Mother went back to her office, did some accounting and called some clients.
Dog lay there on the sofa/bench puffing, eyes begging to be taken for a walk.
The hours passed. Night fell. She got up from the desk and gave in. Her day's
work was done for her but the nagging worries still hung around her.

# the dreamer

When the morning came with the birdsong and the binmen he would wake his
stomach empty, aching  if he hadn't dreamt. Sometimes he would lie there in the
warm marshmallow softness of the quilt and imagine something nice for the
day. An erotic fantasy, a heroic sporting effort, a stroke of mathematical
genius. The magic had been drained from the waking world bottled and stored in
some forbidden zone. What was left was a monotonous drudge of shallow
transactions between economic agents. Their every observable action was logged
and analysed. But in the cosy warmth of his bed nobody but he could record
his dreaming.

Coffee was a ritual, bitter cheap stuff that warmed him in the chill of the
grey dawn as he scribbled his recollections in the notepad. The words came
easily pouring from the pen a little untidily, slightly too large to fit
between the lines on the page. He was embarrassed at his scrawling thoughts.
Shouldn't they be more neatly laid out like a system of equations, or a
spreadsheet with its orderly lines and columns. Orderly, ordered, obeying orders without question. That was the normative future. He had another mouthful of the foul coffee and wondered how much it was staining his teeth. 

# the girl

She had gone, fled the tsunami. Officially it was an epidemic but she had lived it more like the aftermath of an earthquake. A single acute event that provoked a collapse of her society as it had been. All those comfortable certainties were a thing of the past - la vie d'avant. Now there was just the unwelcome suspense whilst waiting for the next official announcement when one would find out what was allowed and what was proscribed until the following announcement. The days of laws carved in stone were gone just a seemingly unending cycle of revocable decision. People huddled together in front of their screens, in awe before the undulating graphs and the latest set of prescriptions that would without doubt extinguish the sickness that had so far resisted all else. 

In Japan some 10 years ago there had been an earthquake and a tsunami that swept through a nuclear power plant. Tsunami is a borrowed word from  japanese just as pork is a borrowed word from French. The French or rather the Normans ate the meat in medieval England and the Saxons ate whatever else was left. And the Japanese, perched on the Pacific survived with earthquakes and the aftermath. After the shock, perhaps many hours later the wave would wreak havoc on the coast - smashing fishing boats to pieces and devastating the villages. She wasn't japanese but she had pictured them walking home in the darkness of that  night after everything had gone down - TV, trains, nuclear power.

She cried again. Life wasn't wasn't a grind but th colours had washed out. No fancy ballerinas for a long time, no makeup, just her cats and the village food. She passed her hand through her hair and resisted sighing. She had sobbed enough for one day and self pity was weakness wasn't it?

# television

The presenter was trying to sound interesting like she had really mastered economics and philosophy. Her tonged blond hair was a little too artificial, too lacquered to be really natural. She read the words, just as stiff as her hair from a tablet or some other electronic crutch. Her piercing blue eyes gave her a veneer of sharp intelligence but her questions were soft punches and the politician easily recovered form her faint blows. They had ten minutes of this shadow boxing passed off as serious journalistic work. The dreamer yawned, crossed the room and poured some more of the hideous coffee. The aging weather woman would soon be there to soothe his mounting anger with her comforting maternal smile and sensible clothes.

# single child

Mother fed the dog again. He looked at her expectantly as she dished the meat in his bowl. Guilty or angry hard to say, she avoided his gaze and wondered what her daughter would eat tonight or even if she would eat at all. She resisted caressing his fluffiness as he gulped down the dinner. The dog was a wonderfully faithful creature, existing in a tiny world of satisfied desire. Her daughter had learned that there was so much more to life and been seduced by the unbearable vastness of the world. So she was left with the dog and the daughter had flown.

For all his beauty, strength and loyalty the dog would never fill the whole in her heart left by the daughter.

# the kid

The music paused and his phone buzzed with an incoming call. He fiddled with
the interface as he walked, failing to accept the call from his daughter. She
hardly ever called so he texted back. His experience of modern parenthood
consisted of a sporadic series of brief text messages and occasional voice
calls. The pleasure of tiny voices, laughter and the delightful chaos of time
spent with small children was but a faded memory. He'd call her back in 30
minutes after he'd done his rounds.

She sobbed. Her words were barely understandable, not quite a mumble but a
string of utterances punctuated by the sobbing. He comforted her with borrowed
phrases that were not his
- it's not that bad
- we'll figure something out
- don't worry. He resisted saying that he knew what it was like for they both
  knew that he had never had to deal with this kind of failure. Sure there had
  been screw ups in his life but never quite like this. He knew she knew that
  and to lie would be a betrayal of who they both were.

The sobbing seconds passed and he told her that they should meet the next day
for lunch and talk, plan the future, maybe that would work. It's uncomfortable
listening to the tearful tale, impotent, powerless to change things for your
issue.

# presents

The phone rang. Actually it didn't ring as such but the jingle it played
dragged him away from the TV. He fumbled trying to swipe the right way on the
screen. There was an awkward moment, that silence when you are never sure that
you got the gesture right,  before he heard her voice. 

- What creams have you got?
- I'm not sure, I'll look. There's one here on the table and some in the bathroom.
- Can you check now please? I want to send you some more.

Up he got a little reluctantly  from his cosy nest on the sofa but what else could he do?

- The one on the table is a moisturiser.
- Do you use it?
- Sure. 
- What about the other ones?


There were three of the brown jars on the shelf each with a dainty handwritten label.

- Well there's an SJW, St Johns's Wort, and a lavender. Oh and another SJW.
- Only four? I thought I had given you more.
- I think I gave some as gifts to friends. That's OK isn't it?
- Yes. Do you use them all?
- Sure. I use the moisturiser but not so much the others.
- I just want to be sure before I send you more.

She was so kind in a way that children are and teenagers aren't. These might be
all that he would get by the way of gifts this Xmas. Yet he was, if not
ungrateful then reluctant to take what he didn't really need. His life was so
full of things that he hardly used. Cupboards full of clothes, a fridge and
freezer packed with food, shelves of beautiful books dusty, unopened. He needed
so little to be contented and he had so much that tied him down.

# rain


The muddy grass was slippy underfoot. He preferred the bitumen of the road even if friends had been warning him for forty years that the impact of running would ruin his knees. Up he got on his toes, jogging gently, coaxing muscles to pull together. There was a hundred metres to the next patch of sodden grassy path. 

Once on the real road he got back on the toes before hitting the gas and breaking into a run. The empty road wound round, through the campus buildings. He avoided the puddles when he could. Wet feet and blisters go together. The rain wasn't heavy but it was cold and it sapped his running mojo. The hot summer days were memories and he contemplated without pleasure the coming passage across barren winters days.

Feet slapped in the wet throwing water up on his calves. He lumbered along, keeping a rhythm,  swaying from one leg to another and breathing through his nose. It would be over soon and he would be back in the warmth, perhaps in a bath. There was nobody else here in the rain. An occasional car or a bus but not a soul on foot. You had to be some kind of crazy fool to venture out in this weather. 

He came to the river. It wasn't a torrent here like higher in the mountains, broad with sandy banks, slithering along between the tree lined dykes. He walked a few metres as if to catch his breath but just admitting the rocky wall in beyond then set off with renewed vigour. It's hard in the rain to keep one's spirits up, to drive forward against the elements as they push back. At least in the valley there was rarely any wind to speak of. 

There was a path that branched off, back into the campus. He didn't often take it but today he couldn't face the slippy section by the river where dead leaves clung to the pavement. So he ran on with hideous prefabricated huts on either side nothing like the elegant gothic or doric buildings one finds in other far off campuses in the US, the UK or even China. What kind of mind did they concoct in these ugly places?

Back on the broad road again he concentrated on his breath, measuring each effort with precision. It was getting wetter but he had only 5 minutes or so to go. Sometimes he wondered if this kind of sport wasn't some kind of gross perversion as the best part was the absence of effort, of suffering when it was over for another day.

The watch beeped. He had done his penance for the day and took to jogging again. Thighs ached slightly, muscles tight from the cold. He wondered if ugly minds too could understand why all this was necessary.
