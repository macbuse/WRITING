# mother

She looked at the dog again. Big, muscly but cuddly in his furriness. He smiled
back at her, tongue poking out, puffing a little. Her daughter had gone off and
left her with this wonderful beast. The kid was off on the other side of the
world doing whatever and she was left feeding her pooch.

Mother went back to her office, did some accounting and called some clients.
Dog lay there on the sofa/bench puffing, eyes begging to be taken for a walk.
The hours passed. Night fell. She got up from the desk and gave in. Her day's
work was done for her but the nagging worries still hung around her.

# the dreamer

When the morning came with the birdsong and the binmen he would wake his
stomach empty, aching  if he hadn't dreamt. Sometimes he would lie there in the
warm marshmallow softness of the quilt and imagine something nice for the
day. An erotic fantasy, a heroic sporting effort, a stroke of mathematical
genius. The magic had been drained from the waking world bottled and stored in
some forbidden zone. What was left was a monotonous drudge of shallow
transactions between economic agents. Their every observable action was logged
and analysed. But in the cosy warmth of his bed nobody but he could record
his dreaming.

Coffee was a ritual, bitter cheap stuff that warmed him in the chill of the
grey dawn as he scribbled his recollections in the notepad. The words came
easily pouring from the pen a little untidily, slightly too large to fit
between the lines on the page. He was embarrassed at his scrawling thoughts.
Shouldn't they be more neatly laid out like a system of equations, or a
spreadsheet with its orderly lines and columns. Orderly, ordered, obeying orders without question. That was the normative future. He had another mouthful of the foul coffee and wondered how much it was staining his teeth. 

# the girl

She had gone, fled the tsunami. Officially it was an epidemic but she had lived it more like the aftermath of an earthquake. A single acute event that provoked a collapse of her society as it had been. All those comfortable certainties were a thing of the past - la vie d'avant. Now there was just the unwelcome suspense whilst waiting for the next official announcement when one would find out what was allowed and what was proscribed until the following announcement. The days of laws carved in stone were gone just a seemingly unending cycle of revocable decision. People huddled together in front of their screens, in awe before the undulating graphs and the latest set of prescriptions that would without doubt extinguish the sickness that had so far resisted all else. 

In Japan some 10 years ago there had been an earthquake and a tsunami that swept through a nuclear power plant. Tsunami is a borrowed word from  japanese just as pork is a borrowed word from French. The French or rather the Normans ate the meat in medieval England and the Saxons ate whatever else was left. And the Japanese, perched on the Pacific survived with earthquakes and the aftermath. After the shock, perhaps many hours later the wave would wreak havoc on the coast - smashing fishing boats to pieces and devastating the villages. She wasn't japanese but she had pictured them walking home in the darkness of that  night after everything had gone down - TV, trains, nuclear power.

She cried again. Life wasn't wasn't a grind but th colours had washed out. No fancy ballerinas for a long time, no makeup, just her cats and the village food. She passed her hand through her hair and resisted sighing. She had sobbed enough for one day and self pity was weakness wasn't it?

# television

The presenter was trying to sound interesting like she had really mastered economics and philosophy. Her tonged blond hair was a little too artificial, too lacquered to be really natural. She read the words, just as stiff as her hair from a tablet or some other electronic crutch. Her piercing blue eyes gave her a veneer of sharp intelligence but her questions were soft punches and the politician easily recovered form her faint blows. They had ten minutes of this shadow boxing passed off as serious journalistic work. The dreamer yawned, crossed the room and poured some more of the hideous coffee. The aging weather woman would soon be there to soothe his mounting anger with her comforting maternal smile and sensible clothes.

# single child

Mother fed the dog again. He looked at her expectantly as she dished the meat in his bowl. Guilty or angry hard to say, she avoided his gaze and wondered what her daughter would eat tonight or even if she would eat at all. She resisted touching his fluffiness as he gulped down the dinner. The dog was a wonderfully faithful creature, existing in a tiny world of satisfied desire. Her daughter had learned that there was so much more to life and seen the unbearable vastness of the world. So she was left with the dog and the daughter had flown.
