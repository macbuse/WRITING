#  Of Mice and Men


## A new path

The mouse is the curse of our day. It slides awkwardly across the tabletop distracting, demanding to be caressed, fidgeted with. In my youth there were no
mice, just keyboards, and there was only one window. Journalists on TV told us
that the future would be graphic, desktops and icons, with the mouse aiding us
to navigate this simulacre of an office. A worlf fit for businesses to do
business.

One day last year I cracked. The hours of daily scrolling, clumsily sending the cursor to the right place. Maybe was age and diminishing coordination but I was becomingincreasingly frustrated with man mouse interactions. So I chose to go back to the ways of my youth: a bare terminal with just the keys to place the cursor and select blocks of text. 

In fact the tools of my youth had had a reboot since. 
- vi had become vim then neovim
- the vt100 terminal was replaced by xterm
- tmux was a new boy in town 

The latter is indeed a strange beast. The idea of replacing the whole 
world of the glitzy graphical interface with a group of terminals inside just one solitary window might seem regressive but the simplicity it brings is quite stunning. 

I joined the tribe of digital refuseniks who had turned their back on the
promised land of mice and men. I installed, configured and then began to work on
my muscle memory. The first few weeks were painful but the calmness of the
terminal devoid of icons and buttons was some comfort. It was like going from
the bustle of a noisy, polluted city to the depth of the country with just the
stars in the night sky for company. I could breath again. My eyes no longer
ached from the glarish iconography of the toolbar. Of course this wasn't a place
for the many just a few select souls would choose to stray from the beaten path,
abandoning the traditional ways, to seek out such a haven.

So I relearned the arcane ways of vi and, with the help of other tribesmen, I reconfigured it, adding yet more esoteric functionality. I struggled with the keyboard and the configuration files. I pored over long, abstruse tutorials tweaking until my fingers were caloused and my brain hurt. And I still do even many months after my induction into the strange brotherhood devoted to the way of the terminal. Every day brings a new lesson in true path to enlightenment.

## Shortcuts

I always liked shortcuts - key combinations that allow direct access to some
functionality without clicking through a menu. Some are easy to remember:
- ctrl C
- ctrl V
- ctrl X
- ctrl W

These little things speed up workflow and reduce fatigue once learnt. The
cogniscenti speak of muscle memory, a magical state of mastery where one applies
shortcuts without conscious intervention. To reach this plane of enlightenment
one must usually spend months and sometimes years as a humble adept. The hands
of a true master flirt with the keyboard as he effortlessly casts his spells
whilst the uninitiated looks on in wonder.

Of course, the layman chained to his mouse, who sees the computer merely as a means to an end could never appreciate these feats of man machine symbiosis. In the land of the geek the master of the keybindings is king.

## Purpose

So what is the function of a computer?
- to fill out the myriad online forms
- to create reports and othersuch documents
- to create art and images
- to explore the world of knowledge

For the form fillers and report writers the adepts of memory muscle must seems
strange, unworldy creatures. Why should someone turn their back on the glossy
presentation of the word processor? Reciprocally, for the geek, the conceit of
simulating the experience of paper onscreen is futile, for by binding oneself to a mental model that relies so much on incorporating physical concepts limits the possibilities for imagination. 

What is a document and where does it exist? The evolution, at least as far as
I recall, went somethng like:
- oral traditions
- clay tablets
- scrolls 
- manuscript books
- printed books

So for much of the history of civilization written texts have been the
reference model. 
- But why should that be the case now?
- Why should information be organized as book, chapter, verse?

Indeed the beautiful words of Omar Khayyam seem to have lost their pertinence in
respect of texts (though perhaps history is another question):
```
The Moving Finger writes; and, having writ,
Moves on: nor all thy Piety nor Wit
Shall lure it back to cancel half a Line,
Nor all thy Tears wash out a Word of it.
```
Texts are written and rewritten, edited and reedited in cycles of change
converging towards a quasi final form. For the wily geek will fork and recraft the works of his fellows. To accomplish this he craves the perfect tool, that which renders his task facile, which allows one to find the path of least resistence. According to some Lincoln once said:

```
Give me six hours to chop down a tree 
and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe.
```

The geek adopts a similar approach: honing his skills forsure but spending seemingly inordinate amounts of time configuring the tool for optimal workflow integration. 


## Where did we go wrong?

It is commonly held that GUI is more intuitive than CLI. This maybe true on the
whole but, providing one has mastered the concepts of the OS and file formats,
CLI using a CLI should be at least as natural as a GUI. Whilst the visual
representation of the contents of the computer can be useful, repetively
scrolling through menus  becomes frustrating after even a short time. So whilst the GUI might be ideal for the casual user, for those who spend long periods concentrated on some tricky task it is indeed a barrier to productivity. Once one accepts that the paradigm of mouse and menu, though superficially attractive, is a trap then migrating to a CLI based workflow is the obvious solution.

So why were we seduced and by whom? Why do applications come festooned in ribbons of icons? Sometimes my head aches from strained eyes, forever searching the right button with its signature icon.

With the advent of autocomplete and language servers the CLI has nothing to
envy of the GUI. Life in the stark, dark terminal is a much richer, organic
experience than when being bedazzled by the byzantine iconography of the GUI.
Properly configured vim or somesuch actively cooperates with the user without
being intrusive or claustrophobic.
