# Life in the time of COVID

## Monday

Maybe it started with a sniffle, a runny nose in a meeting. Sat at the back
I wasn't really listening and I my attention dropped off with the irritation of
the mask. A presentation of the functions of various video platforms is hardly
the stuff of dreams and as my nose went from that initial sniffle of rebellion
to a fully fledged torrent of runny mucus I became increasingly distracted. It
finished not before time and I said my perfunctory goodbyes before dashing off.


## Saturday

I wasn't sure before but now my sense of taste had clearly gone. Sugary things
were still good but savoury and spice had no meaning, nos substance anymore. 

We met at 11 something in a slightly grubby french café. She had a tea and
I sipped a panaché - an insipid mix of lemonade and poor beer. We dodged the
sun for a while before moving on to a bistro. High tables and stools admiring
the passers by. Time passed quickly and we shuffled off after a couple of
hours.
