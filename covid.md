# Life in the time of COVID

## Monday

Maybe it started with a sniffle, a runny nose in a meeting. Sat at the back
I wasn't really listening and I my attention dropped off with the irritation of
the mask. A presentation of the functions of various video platforms is hardly
the stuff of dreams and as my nose went from that initial sniffle of rebellion
to a fully fledged torrent of runny mucus I became increasingly distracted. It
finished not before time and I said my perfunctory goodbyes before dashing off.


## Saturday

I wasn't sure before but now my sense of taste had clearly gone. Sugary things
were still good but savoury and spice had no meaning, nos substance anymore. 

We met at 11 something in a slightly grubby french café. She had a tea and
I sipped a panaché - an insipid mix of lemonade and poor beer. We dodged the
sun for a while before moving on to a bistro. High tables and stools admiring
the passers by. Time passed quickly and we shuffled off after a couple of
hours.

The evening was relentlessly boring without taste. It's funny as the word that
describes this absence is such an uncommon little thing that I had to look it up - ageusia.
Blindness and deafness are words that we learn as children but ageusia is
a rarity indeed. Milton was blind and Beethoven deaf. But nobody can name
a victim of ageusia. Food lost its meaning. My diet is basic but spicy and
savoury - some protein with rice and vegetables. I prepare my own meals,
varying the mix of spice and sweetness from the vegetables according to my
palate. Then there was no palate just an empty void of blandness. When we are
blind we are in the dark, deaf in silence but with ageusia there is only
blandness.

## Second Monday

The doctor was courteous as always. He listened took temperature and blood
pressure neither of which were cause for concern. I coughed a couple of times,
told him about the ageusia and asked for a prescription for the PCR test. 
He duly wrote it, I paid and we parted.

The woman in the laboratory told me that nothing was available before the end
of the week and the results would be another week. WTF. She suggested I try the
hospital so I did. After the usual run around I found the right web page,
filled in the form and had a test booked for the next morning. 

The rest of the day was spent curled on the canopé between sleep and
drowsiness punctuated with text messages and mails.

## Testing Tuesday

The test center was located in a room off the entry lobby of a posh new
building on campus. It was one of those shiny prestige projects that the
university had obtained on the never-never or PPP as it was called now - public
private partnership - a insidious sleight of hand dreamt up by accountancy firms.  
I announced myself to the receptionists who promptly asked me to fill out
a form that I had already completed online. He ushered me to the waiting area
then a few minutes later reappeared with the form which I should fill out
imperatively lest the administration wither and crumble away. I complied,
returned the form and watched him as he struggled to disinfect the pen.

There was a 10 minute wait listening to the exchanges between the staff.
I admired the sparkling newness of my surroundings taking a photo for
posterity. Finally they called me as ever mispronouncing my name.  I sat myself
down before the two administrative agents, 
separated from them by a makeshift perspex screen, all three of us masked.
It took a while for them to fill in the form online that I had already
completed the day before, meticulously transcribing the handwritten data.
The one on the left dictated whilst the one on the right typed. It appeared
that they hadn't done this before as on completing the task they gleefully
congratulated themselves.

I passed briefly to the next waiting area - a sort of booth with a solitary
seat
- before being called to the business end. The two medical staff were clad in
those surgical blue gowns, with matching headcoverings. All three of us were
masked so the exchanges were formal, eye contact cursory behind those fetching
goggles. I blew my nose dutifully and prepared for the nasal probe. Down it
went, twirling a little then some more. Ten seconds and whatever chemical they
had impregnated it with began to sting, ten more and I really wanted to sneeze
then it was gone. A few more words to inform me about the results then out the
back door.

Still it is a marvel of modern society that it took five people to carry out
a relatively simple procedure medical and administrative.

## Tuesday back on the bike

Days of eating very little left me lightheaded. I rolled out on the mountain
bike and did a tour in town. Coughed a  little, felt unsure in the saddle but
so what.

I dressed up, pumped up the tyres, checked the water bottle and rolled out on
the road bike. It's a nervous beast with narrow bars, slim tyres, deep rims.
Riding it is not for the faint hearted but once you are dialled in it is
heaven.

The legs were all twisted from lazing on the sofa. 

I stopped half way, stretched and coughed for an eternity. Somebody once said
that there is a moment when you sneeze when you are close to death. Poised
unable to breath before emptying lungs through nostrils, blowing off like some
whale.
