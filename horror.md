## Rainland

The hiss of the rain beating on the road provided a comforting background white
noise. Lounging in the chair he paused the video and sipped on a gin and tonic.
Maybe wasn't so much the road as the lush foliage of the trees surrounding
the house. In any case, whether it landed on road or leaves the rain fell through the same cavernous darkness.

Another evening spent researching the eminent John Dee. Scholar, mathematician , wizard of sorts. His biography was fascinating.

Another sip of gin before the next installment of the works of Dr Dee. He savoured the bitterness of the tonic and imagined Dee and Kelley engaged in their arcane rites, summoning the dead and the angels. Forbidden knowledge is hard to come by even in a world of 24/7 news but in Elizabethan times it must have been precious beyond dreams. So they indulged in the forbidden arts, communing with unworldly spirits to glean insight. He perused the symbols, the hieroglyphs on the pages and wondered how they could have believed that therein lay dark power.

Consciousness slipped away and he sunk into the cosy warmth of the canap√©. Sleep ebbed and flowed interspersed with sporadic excursions into the real of dreams. In the waking moments he tried to capture the fragments of the dreams before the shattered and dispersed. 



## Morning

There were a couple of slugs on the rugs by the window. Why they would venture out of the lush carpet of the lawn to slither over a rough matting he would never understand. But to boldly go....

Coffee was always good before thinking.
