The birds still woke him each morning. Midsummer had passed but the days were
still long. The silence of living alone was losing some of its magic though he
didn't miss the brutal noise of the crockery being stowed away. He appreciated
every little tweet in the chaotic chorus sometimes attempting to extract some
sense from them. Mightn't there be a hidden divine message in the anarchy of the
birdsong. With fanciful thoughts like that he kept himself from drowning in the
daily tedium.
