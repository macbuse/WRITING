# Morning

The birds still woke him each morning. Midsummer had passed but the days were
still long perhaps a little too long. The silence of living alone was losing some of its magic though he
didn't miss the brutal noise of the crockery being stowed away. He appreciated
every little tweet in the chaotic chorus sometimes attempting to extract some
sense from them. Mightn't there be a hidden divine message in the anarchy of the birdsong. With fanciful thoughts like that he kept himself from drowning in the daily tedium.


Another cup of the bitter brownness that served as coffee. Another bite of the chewy pastry that imitated a croissant. The days were not tainted by torture as they had been for previous generations but nor were they replete with joy.


He missed voices. Those exchanges, no matter how banal, that had broken the silence before. The void they left was populated by ideas, each seductively distracting, demanding his attention like some wanton nymph only to abandon him, sitting there feeling desperately unsatisfied and abused. Conscious that his pursuit would forever be in vain he chased them nonetheless. Intellectual vanity. Sometimes he would conjure a voice from memory and coax it to repeat a tender phrase. For a moment the company relieved his loneliness before he returned to the hunt.


Occasionally he would wander out and look at real people instead of the two dimensional representations that visited via the internet. These souls  were solid and real enough but often masked so interactions were limited if not strained. Every word they spoke muffled, their breath filtered in these times of crisis. If he was lucky there might be a glint in an unshielded eye, something to treasure for the remainder of the day. Otherwise he returned home wretched,
despairing at the plight of humanity, transformed into faceless creatures
fearing contact with each other.


He clicked through a sequence of videos on the TV. Actually it had ceased to be a TV in the traditional sense and was now a monitor plugged into the jungle of streaming. In his childhood there had been but two choices, or three if you counted switching off the box. Now he chose from millions and millions of competing voices, each and everyone enticing you to spend  5, 10, 15 minutes of pseudo celebrity with them. Broadcasting was no longer just for big players, for governments and corporations. Teenagers, disenchanted middle age boomers and even the elderly preached to the world vying for a place amongst the background rumble of music videos.

So this was his world for the moment:
- the birds
- the masked 
- the talking heads.


There was a fourth element in the form of electronically exchanged texts, brief emails, comments online. The phone vibrate and he scrambled to read the incoming message. Typically a few words confirming that someone had not forgotten him. Whilst the isolation was not in itself unbearable the fear of being wiped out of the continuing narrative was. The birds chirped their senseless stories and men constructed narrative. The indecipherable song of the birds was calming just as the babble of the brook or the arcane hieroglyphs written in the summer clouds. But the waves of narrative had worn him down, eroding and corroding. A kind word was always welcome as was an enquiry after his well being before submersion  in the sea of narrative again.

- How are you today?
- What u up to?
- Are you feeling better?

A gasp of kindness before plunging the depths of anonymity.


# Cooking

The oil hissed in the pan, drops of water boiling off. In went the cumin seeds, curry leaves, chili peppers. Later he would add round yellow mustard seeds that would pop reminding him to mix in onion and garlic. It was good to have a routine, it was good to make something all by oneself. All the while the rice cooked automatically in one of those machines that all Japanese households have. It would have just the right texture and be just salty enough without the least intervention.

He flicked through some more videos waiting on the oily curry mix to cook down.
Should he add tomato? Today's videos were much the same as yesterdays and
today's curry would be much the same as last week's. A staleness was creeping
in to his life that the freshness of the ingredients could not disguise.
Technique was replacing spontaneity and he didn't even have the status of the
wise sage that had been the consolation for men of his age down the millennia.

The birds taunted him with an improvised series of chirps and whistles.

Men hadn't cooked before. It was a woman's work. Now he cheerfully stirred,
tasted, seasoned and dreamt of a world where these mundane chores had been banished.
The curry progressed, developing subtle flavour over a background of spiciness.

# Going out

It was a big day. He headed out to take the tram. After 100 metres he  fumbled
in his pockets, found no mask and turned back. People were maskless, face naked
in the streets now but indoors and in trains and trams one had to conceal ones
features lest the pestilence take its course.

The tram was half full of the usual suspects. The students, the elderly and
a couple of parents shepherding their offspring. He ignored all these and fidgeted with his phone, scrolling idly through messages and checking the weather. Hard to believe that the clouds should break soon. Stops passed in quick succession and the usual suspects shuffled off and on. He got off smiling at the beggar in front of the bakers then turning into the narrow streets of the old town. He swerved past the delivery boys on their electric bikes, crossed the busy road that slithered along with the river and then the footbridge to the other bank.

He hung his jacket on the back of the chair and they sat in the sun. 
- Sorry I'm late. How's things?
- Great! What about you?
- Well it's still not easy, the broken arm and that.
- Really? Too bad.

The waiter came and they ordered some beer. It came, they drank and chatted.
Catch up on lives that had if not diverged then separated. It was good to hear
a voice again to steer a conversation, navigating through topics and mixing the trivial with more substantial. It wasn't noisy sat here but the chorus of the birds ever present at home was absent. Their conversation meandered without comfortably purposeless
- children and parents
- beer and food
- friends and fools.
No politics nor football. Nothing in the least controversial that might divide opinion.
