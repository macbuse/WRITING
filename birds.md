The birds still woke him each morning. Midsummer had passed but the days were
still long. The silence of living alone was losing some of its magic though he
didn't miss the brutal noise of the crockery being stowed away. He appreciated
every little tweet in the chaotic chorus sometimes attempting to extract some
sense from them. Mightn't there be a hidden divine message in the anarchy of the
birdsong. With fanciful thoughts like that he kept himself from drowning in the
daily tedium.

Another cup of the bitter brownness that served as coffee. Another bite of the
chewy pastry that imitated a croissant. The days were not tainted by torture as
they had been for previous generations but nor were they filled with joy.

He missed voices. Exchanges, no matter how banal. The void they left was
populated by ideas, each seductively distracting, demanding his attention like some wanton
nymph only to abandon him feeling desperately unsatisfied and abused. Conscious
that his pursuit would forever be in vain he chased them nonetheless.
Intellectual vanity. Sometimes he would conjure a voice from memory and
coax it to repeat a tender phrase. For a moment the company relieved his
loneliness before he returned to the hunt.

Occasionally he would wander out and look at real people instead of the two
dimensional representations that the internet permitted to visit. These souls  were
solid and real enough but often masked so interactions were limited if not strained.
Every word they spoke muffled, their breath filtered in these times of crisis.
If he was lucky there might be a glint in an unshielded eye, something to
treasure for the remainder of the day. Otherwise he returned home wretched,
despairing at the plight of humanity, transformed into faceless creatures
fearing contact with each other.
