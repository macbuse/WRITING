I listen to speakers on youtube. Eloquent, clever people talking about
complicated subjects. They blithely communicate their opinions
in sentences that frequently make sense. For all their sophistication there are
moments when they pause unsure of the next word. Perhaps their tongue has run
ahead of their brain and so they must pause while the lesser organ catches up.
Instantly and instinctively I cannot stop myself from completing their sentence
often with a more elegant formulation.
A little phrase that fits perfectly in the discourse.

Why is such a feat of recollection so easy when the rest of my memory is now so riddled with holes? Years of vitamin
deficiency have transformed my mind into a great empty cathedral where ghostly echoes of the
choir resound. 
There in a heavy tome, my past is recorded in ink that is 
fading as I read, on crumbling, yellowed paper.
 Such a fragile manuscript apt to disintegrate before my eyes.
 But I am not frightened for the magnificence of the cathedral is quite overwhelming.
 There is always a detail of the architecture, some wondrous piece of ornate carving
 or moulding that captures my attention and I forget that I have forgotten
 almost everything now.

 Words have their own existence. They snuggle up to me like pets and curl up there, purring comfortingly. 
 Peoples' names are another beast altogether. Remembering
 a name is a difficult, almost perilous task. It feels like climbing a cliff,
 searching out handholds, looking for the route back to that person exquisitely tense, for at any moment my grip might fail and I will tumble into the abyss.
 Each hold is tied, however tenuously to the person I have in mind. 
 Each of my handles takes the form of something more
 familiar, an associate, an event, a character trait or some other personal scrap. 
 Sometimes I surprise myself succeeding in an instant to traverse this sinuous route,
 sometimes I wake in the night when my subconscious
 has achieved what the woken mind couldn't.
 Happy all the same even if I had fumbled before.

 So the words are my roots extending deep into the ground fixing in me in reality. 
 Whenever the fog rolls in paralysing my mind and I stumble and fumble as I have so many times,
 they are still there helping me find a way around even in the depths of despair. Familiar, comforting I sit among them and savour their company, their connotations.
