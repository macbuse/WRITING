I listen to speakers on youtube. Eloquent, clever people talking about
complicated subjects. They blithely communicate their opinions
in sentences that frequently make sense. For all their sophistication there are
moments when they pause unsure of the next word. Perhaps their tongue has run
ahead of their brain and so they must pause whilst the lesser organ catches up.
Without thinking I complete the sentence
often with a more elegant formulation.
A little phrase that fits perfectly in the discourse.

Why this is it so easy when the rest of my memory is now so full of holes? Years of vitamin
deficiency have transformed my mind into a great empty cathedral where ghostly echoes of the
choir resound. 
There in a heavy tome, my past is recorded in ink that is 
fading as I read, on crumbling, yellowed paper,
 such a fragile manuscript.
 But I am not frightened for the magnificence of the cathedral is quite overwhelming.
 There is always a detail of the architecture, some wondrous piece of ornate carving
 or moulding that captures my attention and I forget that I have forgotten
 almost everything now.
