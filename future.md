# Future

As a kid I often  had my nose in a SF book. Stories of space travel, time
travel, robots, aliens devoured savagely, sprawled on my bed. 
Later there was a sprinkling of cyber punk usually consumed between the covers
of some beautifully drawn comic.

In the real world I prayed that a utopia would come our way, delivered by the
wonders of science but the writers invariably fed me a dystopian, post
apocalyptic view. Perfectly natural, for whilst nuclear power seemed to promise
a world without the dark, dangerous labour of the coal mine, its evil twin the
atomic bomb threatened to wipe us all from the face of god's Earth. The
writers explored the gritty aftermath of the nuclear war whilst I dreamt of the
aseptic neon lit electric paradise. Surrounded by super intelligent robots and
gleaming aluminium flying cars I lived a life of leisure and luxury untroubled
by sickness or old age.

I guess that kind of world doesn't sell. Readers need struggle, misery,
catastrophe to be truly captured.
