# Knowledge

I seem to remember a time when wisdom was owned by, if not the aged, then those
who had lived long and wonderful lives. Great men who had acquired knowledge
through experience and study. It was a privilege to listen to them explain the
workings of the universe or patiently recount some tale of extraordinary deeds.

Those times are gone, swept away by new mores. We are told to forget those that
I so fondly remember for they were not enlightened according to the new standards. Their effigies must be torn down and consigned to the murky depths forever.

A new world has been born where we must strive not to crush the most
vulnerable, where we must repair the injustices of centuries long past. There are days when I dare not venture out for I fear that by walking carelessly I'll crush some small insignificant blossom underfoot. The unintentional
slight the merest faux pas can, as with the butterfly effect, be amplified in a quite unforeseeable manner and finnish by whipping up a mighty storm.
In this chaotic new world the apocalypse
is brought on after a few petals are accidentally crushed

Who can profit from such a state of affairs? Who can create ina world with so
many constraints? 

The proponents of this new moral framework invoke grand principles of humanity.
They often say that their work is merely progress and it is implicit that to
resist progress is futile. But their objective is a nebulous affair. 
Equality or maybe equity or recognition of equivalence, I am never sure which.

Equivalence applied widely in a cultural context seems to me to be a very
dangerous concept. To ignore empirical differences between categories because of
a quite abstract principle is folly. 
This conceit is central to the movement that seeks to erase the memories of
those long dead souls who can no longer defend themselves.
Let us replace them with new paragons, more diverse but perhaps who have not
distinguished themselves to an equal extent.
So change the narrative redefine what is truth. It doesn't matter, Hollywood
and Stalin's Russia have done it all before. 

Where will this all take us? We already live in a world where money has no
value other than what the market decides so why not apply this universally? 
Everyone has an almost equal voice in the void of the ne medias. Unless, of
course, they are deplatformed for a perceived infraction of community standards.
The market should triumph and the manner in which the value of ideas is fixed
must be liberate rad.
The patrician defenders of the old ways must make way for more modern,
democratic ways.

The champions of this new crusade are invariably those who have never suffered in any
meaningful way. Perhaps they cried when their preferred candidate lost the
elections or somesuch. Maybe even when they were verbally insulted but they
have never known the pain of going without or of imminent violence. Their lives
are lived vicariously, they fight for others with no risk of losing.
Like latter-day saints their heads are garnered with halos clearly visible to the discerning brethren on their
profile pictures.

Each and every is reduced to a story of victimhood that the world at large must
strive ceaselessly to repair.
