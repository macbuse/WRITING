# Faces

Whenever I go out I study faces. It's a kind of compulsive behavior.
Whether it is sitting in café or a train or a meeting, I sketch faces
tracing out profiles and the lines that mark the features. 
Noses, mouths, eyes are my stock in trade. Ears rarely interest me.

When all the cafés were shut and the trains stopped and there were only
virtual meetings during lockdown it seemed like crossing a barren desert.
