# Faces

Whenever I go out I study faces. It's a kind of compulsive behavior.
Whether it is sitting in café or a train or a meeting, I sketch faces
tracing out profiles and the lines that mark the features. 
Noses, mouths, eyes are my stock in trade. Ears rarely interest me.

When all the cafés were shut and the trains stopped and there were only
virtual meetings during lockdown it seemed like crossing a barren desert.
The only faces were flat on screen images. The only voices filtered through
headphones. The directness of human presence with all its charming
improvisation was lost.

I was determined not to lose my humanity because of some authoritarian edict.
So I met regularly with two friends. The first an American in the centre
of town and the second a Englishman who was on the other side of town. Both
lived alone if you don't count the american's cat as company. It was a curious
arrangement:  meeting the american in the morning to shop at the market together 
and the englishman to share a glass of whisky in the late afternoon. 
We chatted, discussed the emptiness of the streets and life in general
during this time of illness. 
We sought out a moment of merriment and laughter.
We promised each other that when it was all over 
we would celebrate in fine fashion.
