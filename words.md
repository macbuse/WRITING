# Doldrums

I had a father. He wasn't much of a man compared to my uncles who, if they were
to be believed, the gods had carved from granite or some such. They stood proud though
troubled by the diverse ailments of middle age and boasted of their youth
battling with their fists, pouring molten metal in the sweltering heat of the
furnace halls and countless other wonders. They recounted their tales in gruff
voices just as men born in the wild northern regions have since time
immemorial. Their stories were short and brutal, often with a spikey moral in
their tail. As it unwound little thought was given to the elegance of the language before the jab of the punchline. It was a demonstration of a certain existence, an uncertain physical or intellectual superiority. I listened passively with a polite questioned prepared to confirm the narrator in his moment of triumph.

But my father taught me words. His vocabulary was extensive if sometimes
deployed somewhat pretentiously. Many a time we mocked him for a flagrant over
use of "apparently" but then again in the land of the monosyllabic uncle the little latin scholar is king. By day he composed letters in an grubby little office niched in a dilapidated lane, part of the decaying intestines of a city that still had pretensions to being one of the great cities of the empire. A priori it wasn't the work of a literary man but he took pride in his grand phrases. Frilly pieces of politeness expedited to some stiffish manager in the London office. In the evening he'd teach me his phrases and remind me how important it was to be correct, respectful.

I was listening to a reading of poetry the other day. At first I took the words
for prose. They were rattled off with little passion, bombarding me in a hail of metaphors. The poet, already convinced of her moral superiority, felt no need to seduce the audience. They would applaud at the end, for to abstain would be most disrespectful, yet another slur to add to the inventory of crimes that was the flesh of her verse. There was something automatic, robotic about the whole affair. It was a formal exchange between parties, like the letters of my father. The litany of complaints delivered with the assurance of a small town lawyer irritates and I become indifferent to the plight of the alleged victim.

Now I picture the poet in action before her blank sheets of paper or more
likely
some shining aluminium laptop. 
She labours hours to bring us the fruit of discord, of victimhood. Then
I remember my father proud of his golden fountain pen, covering a page with
a flowery script, laying forth on a trivial matter of administration. Both are
noble in their cause. The former in the lime light of the new media irritates with her strident style. The latter, whether sat in his grim office or surrounded by steam and grease at the kitchen table, irritated in an equal and opposite manner.

So he is gone and I am still here. Typing words - white on black - in a search
for peace, for an exit from the post pandemic doldrums.
