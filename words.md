# Words

I had a father. He wasn't much of a man compared to my uncles who, if they were
to be believed, the gods had carved from granite or some such. They stood proud though
troubled by the diverse ailments of middle age and boasted of their youth
battling with their fists, pouring molten metal in the sweltering heat of the
furnace halls and countless other wonders.

But my father taught me words. His vocabulary was extensive if sometimes
deployed somewhat pretentiously. Many a time we mocked him for a flagrant over
use of "apparently" but then again in the land of the guttural monosyllabic the little latin scholar is king.
